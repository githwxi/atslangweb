<p>
ATS2 (ATS/Postiats) is implemented in ATS1 (ATS/Anairiats),
and ATS1 is implemented in itself. The lastest released version of ATS1 is
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ats-lang/files/latest/download?source=files">ATS1-0.2.11</a>,
which is required to be installed in order to build ATS2.
A simple shell script for installing ATS1 under Linux can be found
<a href="https://github.com/githwxi/ATS-Postiats/blob/master/travis-ci/setup.sh">on-line</a>.
It is clear based on the script that installing ATS1 is essentially the same as installing ATS2.

<p>
Note that the C code generated from compiling ATS1 source is included in a
released package of ATS2. When ATS2 is being built, the included C code is
first compiled by a C compiler (e.g., gcc, clang, etc.) into <u>patsopt</u>
for compiling ATS2 code subsequently.
In general, it often requires very little effort to port ATS2 to a platform
if the platform happens to run a Unix-like OS.

The name
<a href="https://github.com/githwxi/ATS-Postiats">ATS2-github</a>
often refers to the version of ATS2 available at github.com.
This version contains the latest changes made after the last
release of ATS2. Assume that ATS1 has been installed. Then ATS2-github
can be built by issuing the following 3 command-lines after it is first
git-cloned into a directory of the name ATS2-github:
<pre
style="font-size:125%;"
>
cd ATS2-github
make -f codegen/Makefile_atslib
make -f Makefile_devl
</pre>
