# Parsing Combinators

## Project Description

This is just a standard implementation of parsing combinators.
One should be able to make use of it by simply studying the interface
in SATS/parcomb.sats and its implementation in DATS/parcomb.dats.

For a concrete example of using this package, please see the myatscc
utility (located in the local directory ${PATSHOME}/utils/myatscc)
