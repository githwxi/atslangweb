# libatsopt:

# It is really libatsopt_ext
# as it is the extended version
# of ccomp/atslib/lib/libatsopt

# Steps for building libatsopt.a
#
######

Assume that ATS1 is already installed.
Assume that ATS2-github is checked out, which is
the version of ATS2 stored in the following directory:

https://github.com/githwxi/ATS-Postiats

Please use the provided Makefile to build libatsopt.a:

make libatsopt # the built libatsopt.a depends on libgmp (-lgmp)
make libatsopt_min # the built libatsopt.a does not depend on libgmp

After libatsopt.a is successfully built, you need to do:

make libatsopt_ext

After the extended version of libatsopt.a is successfully built,
you can test it by doing:

cd TEST
make patsopt LIBGMP= # for libatsopt.a without libgmp dependency
make patsopt LIBGMP=-lgmp # for libatsopt.a with libgmp dependency

The generated executable 'patsopt' is just the compiler for ATS2 :)

Cheers!
