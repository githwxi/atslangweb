Source code:

The source for compilation is required to be stored under
the PATSHOME directory. For instance, there is a directory of the
name PATSHOME/mytmp that can be used to store source code. One may
want create a symbolic link of this directory for a bit of convenience.

######

Typical usage:

A single-file program in ATS can be compiled as follows:

nodejs patsopt_dats.js -d PATSHOME/mytmp/hello.dats > myout/hello_dats.c

The generated C code can be compiled to into object code by a compiler like
gcc or clang:

CC=gcc & \
${CC} -I${PATSHOME} -I${PATSHOME}/ccomp/runtime -o myout/hello myout/hello_dats.c

Another possibility is for the generated C code to be transpiled into JavaScript
via atscc2js.
