Date: September 19, 2013

This is the second release of ATS2, the successor of the ATS
programming language. The compiler for ATS2 is given the name
ATS/Positats, ATS2/Postiats or simply Postiats.

The official website for ATS is:

http://www.ats-lang.org

ATS-Postiats is hosted at github:

https://github.com/githwxi/ATS-Postiats

Major releases of ATS2 are available at:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/ats2-lang/

Major releases of external packages for ATS2 are available at:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/ats2-lang-contrib/

Here is a list of major additions and changes since the last release:

1. Support for classdec.
   This feature is primarily for building APIs in ATS for external
   packages written in the OOP-style.

2. Support for ATS-package relocation.
   This feature is primarily for renaming and relocating external ATS
   packages (mostly library APIs). It is supposed to work together with
   atspkgreloc, a tool that does the actual package relocation. The tool
   is yet to be implemented.

3. Support for dot-notation overloading:
//
   symintr .x .y
   extern fun point_get_x (p: point): int
   extern fun point_get_y (p: point): int
   overload .x with point_get_x
   overload .y with point_get_y
//
   These declarations enable the following:
   [p.x] translates into [point_get_x(p)]
   [p.y] translates into [point_get_y(p)]

4. Fixing a very serious bug in pattern-matching compilation

5. Relocating contributed packages from ats2-lang to ats2-lang-contrib

6. Improving atslib: adding code, fixing bugs, improving documentation, etc.
