Major releases of external packages for ATS2 are available at:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/ats2-lang-contrib/

Here is a list of major additions and changes since the last release:

1. Fixing a glitch in initializing flat boxed-singleton records
   (see doc/BUGS/bug-2013-11-29)
2. Adding support for jsonizing level-2 syntax trees; this is planned
   for support tasks like meta-programming, constraint-exporting, etc.
3. Adding support for exporting constraints gathered during typechecking
   (command-line flag for this feature: --constraint-export)
4. Fixing bug-2013-12-04 (erroneous compilation of pattern matching)
5. Adding a direct API for the json-c package
6. Adding a direct API for the jansson package
7. Adding a minimal API for the pcre package
8. Adding support for 'static' dynamic constant declarations:
   static fun foo (...): res // this one is equivalent to the next one
   extern fun foo (...): res = "sta#" // it is equivalent to the above one
9. Improving support for exporting ATS-types to C
10. Requiring that each declared toplevel function be envless; closures
    need to be declared as values.
11. Supporting the flag -CSignore for patscc to ignore constraint-solving.
    Please only use it with proper justification!
