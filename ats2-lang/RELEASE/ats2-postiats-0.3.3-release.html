<pre>
0.3.3

This is the 40th release of ATS2, the successor of the
ATS programming language. The compiler for ATS2 is given
the name ATS/Positats, ATS2/Postiats or simply Postiats.

The official website for ATS is:

http://www.ats-lang.org

ATS-Postiats is hosted at github:

https://github.com/githwxi/ATS-Postiats

Major releases of ATS2 are available at:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/ats2-lang/

Major releases of external packages for ATS2 are available at:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/ats2-lang-contrib/

Here is a list of major additions and changes since the last release:

1. Supporting $tempenver in template implementation:
   This is a crucial addition in support of programming in ATS that
   may potentially be (very) deeply template-based!!!
(*
2: Re-arranging (and duplicating) files containing code of template
   implementation may cause the need for $tempenver to change. It is
   not yet understood what the reason is behind all of this behavior.
*)
3. Fixing a glitch involving tail-call optimization; please see the
   function hidexp_seq_simplify for details.
4. Supporting [reassume]: An assumed abstract type can be reassumed
   so as to make its (original) implementation available in the scope
   of the reassume-declaration.
