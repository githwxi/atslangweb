ATS-Postiats is hosted at github:

Here is a list of major additions and changes since the last release:

1. Allowing overloads declared in staloadnm to be merged automatically
2. Initiating libatscc being moved from PATSCONTRIB to PATSHOME/contrib
   In particular, moving of Bacon.js and Worker in libatscc/libatscc2js
   is finished.
(*
//
HX-2017-02-01: Reverted!
// File search in ATS is intentionally different from done in C
//
3. Using pushb (push-from-the-back) to push a path permanently:
   fun the_pathlst_ppushb(x: path): void // see [pats_filename]
   fun the_IATS_dirlst_ppushb (dir: string): void // see [pats_global]
*)
4. Adding support for handling abstract types of unspecified size
5. Adding code into libats/BUCS320/. to support package-based programming
6. Introducing the compilation flag _ATS_CCOMP_ASSUME_CHECK_NONE_ to skip
   over checks that are otherwise required of assuming (i.e., implementing)
   abstract types
7. Moving a lot of code around due to packaging; mostly from PATSCONTRIB
   to PATSHOME/npm-utils
8. Adding support for 'where <declist> end' (besides 'where { <declist> }')
9. Fixing a minor glitch involving typechecking ifcase-expressions
10. Removing duplicates of overloaded dynamic constants and variables
