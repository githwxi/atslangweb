<h2><a id="ATS_packages">ATS packages for download</a></h2>

<p>
ATS is Open Source and Free Software, and it is freely available under the
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE version 3 (GPLv3) as is published by the Free
Software Foundation. The current implementation of ATS is given the name
ATS/Postiats or simply Postiats. Sometimes, this implementation is also
referred to as ATS2 for it is the successor of the previous ATS programming
language, which may be referred to as ATS1. The latest released
ATS/Postiats packages are available at the following links:

<h2><a id="Requirements_install">Requirements for installation</a></h2>

<p>
The following requirements are supposed to be met in order to install ATS:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Operating System requirement:
ATS is supported under the following operating systems:
<ul>
<li>Linux</li>
<li>MacOS</li>
<li>Windows with Cygwin</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Programming Language requirement: GNU C-Compiler (gcc). Other C-compilers
should also work in principle. In particular, it is known that both clang
and <a href="http://bellard.org/tcc/">tcc</a> can succeed in compiling both
ATS1 and ATS2.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you are able to port ATS to a platform not listed here, please drop us
a note so that other users of ATS may benefit.
</p>

<p>
The GMP library (libgmp.a), which is in general included in a GNU/Linux
distribution, is currently required for installing a release of ATS2.
Please see <a href="http://gmplib.org">http://gmplib.org</a> for more

<h2><a id="Install_of_ATS2_contrib">Installation of ATS2-contrib</a></h2>

<p>
ATS2-contrib primarily consists of external contributions in the forms
of library packages, tutorials, examples, all sorts of documentation, etc.
</p>

<p>
After downloading a release of ATS2-contrib <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ats2-lang-contrib/download">on-line</a>,
please untar it in a directory, say MYATS, of your choice. This, for
instance, can be done by executing the following command-line:

<div>
tar -zvxf ATS2-contrib-x.x.x.tgz
</div>

where <u>ATS2-contrib-x.x.x.tgz</u> refers to the downloaded package and
x.x.x is the version number of the package.  All the files and directories
extracted from the tarball are now in the directory <u>MYATS/ATS2-Postiats-contrib-x.x.x</u>.

</p>

<p>

Please set the environment variable PATSHOMERELOC to this directory name
and then you are ready to use ATS2-contrib.  If you want to set
${PATSHOMERELOC} to be the same as ${PATSHOME}, then please move the
content of the directory <u>MYATS/ATS2-Postiats-contrib-x.x.x</u> into
${PATSHOME}.

</p>

<p>

If you have access to the <em>git</em< command, then you can also do a
git-clone to obtain the current release of ATS2-contrib:

<div>
git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/ats2-lang-contrib/code ATS-Postiats-contrib
