<h2>Introduction to Programming in ATS</h2>

<p>
This book starts from the core of ATS, a statically typed call-by-value
functional programming language, and introduces the reader to dependent
types, linear types and the paradigm of programming with
theorem-proving. It assumes no familiarity of the reader with functional
programming.
