<h2>What is ATS?</h2>

<p>
ATS is a statically typed programming language that unifies
implementation with formal specification. It is equipped with a highly
expressive type system rooted in the framework <em>Applied Type
System</em>, which gives the language its name.  In particular, both
dependent types and linear types are available in ATS.
</p>

<p>
The current implementation of ATS2 (ATS/Postiats) is written in ATS1
(ATS/Anairiats). ATS can be as efficient as C/C++ both time-wise and
memory-wise and supports a variety of programming paradigms that include:
</p>

<h2>What is ATS good for?</h2>

<ul>

<li>
ATS can enforce great precision in practical programming.
</li>

<li>
ATS allows the programmer to write efficient functional programs that
directly manipulate native unboxed data representation.
</li>

<li>
ATS allows the programmer to reduce the memory footprint of a program
by making use of linear types.
</li>

<li>
ATS allows the programmer to enhance the safety (and efficiency) of a
program by making use of theorem-proving.
</li>

<li>
ATS allows the programmer to write safe low-level code that runs in OS
kernels.
</li>

<li>
ATS can help teach type theory, demonstrating concretely
the power and potential of types in constructing high-quality software.
</li>

</ul>
